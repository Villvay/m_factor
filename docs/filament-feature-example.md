## Time-Saving Tips for Filament Features

### 1. Use Filament Plugins (Save 50-70% time)
```bash
# Example: Spatie Media Library Plugin
composer require filament/spatie-laravel-media-library-plugin

# Example: Filament Shield (permissions)
composer require bezhansalleh/filament-shield
```

### 2. Leverage Filament's Built-in Features
- **Table Builders**: Automatic sorting, searching, pagination
- **Form Builder**: Validation, conditional fields, layouts
- **Actions**: Reusable action classes
- **Widgets**: Dashboard components

### 3. Common Patterns to Reuse

**Status Badge Helper:**
```php
Tables\Columns\BadgeColumn::make('status')
    ->colors([
        'danger' => 'rejected',
        'warning' => 'pending',
        'success' => 'approved',
    ])
```

**Bulk Actions:**
```php
Tables\Actions\BulkAction::make('approve')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->approve())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
```

## Estimation Formula for New Filament Features

### Basic Formula:
```
Base CRUD Time: 4-6 hours
+ Business Logic: 2-4 hours per complex rule
+ UI Customization: 1-2 hours per custom component
+ Integration: 2-4 hours per external system
+ Testing & Polish: 20% of total
= Total Hours
```

### Quick Reference Table

| Feature Type | Typical Hours | Example |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Simple CRUD | 4-6 | Categories, Tags |
| CRUD + Relationships | 6-10 | Users with Roles |
| Workflow Feature | 10-16 | Approval Process |
| Dashboard/Analytics | 8-12 | Custom Widgets |
| Complex Integration | 16-24 | Payment Processing |

## Best Practices for Accurate Estimation

1. **Add 20-30% buffer** for unexpected complexity
2. **Consider existing code** - Can you reuse components?
3. **Check for plugins** - Don't reinvent the wheel
4. **Account for testing** - Especially for critical features
5. **Include documentation time** - Help text, admin guides

### Red Flags That Increase Time:
- "Just make it work like [complex external system]"
- Multiple levels of approval
- Real-time requirements
- Complex permission matrices
- Heavy customization of Filament defaults
