## Critical Path Items

These items block other development and should be prioritized:

1. **Database Schema** - Blocks all other development
2. **Authentication System** - Required for all user features
3. **Matching Algorithm** - Core business logic
4. **Search Interface** - Primary user interaction
5. **Analytics Infrastructure** - Must be in place early to capture all touchpoints

## Key MVP Features Focus

### Core Features Included
- Multi-role authentication with social login
- reCAPTCHA protection against bots
- Provider approval workflow
- Advanced matching algorithm with rotation
- Location-based search with filters
- Provider profiles and contact system

- Admin panel for management

### Features Excluded from MVP
- A/B testing framework
- External API development (using Inertia instead)
- Advanced reporting (basic Filament dashboards only)
- Provider-contributed content
- Appointment booking integration
- Multi-language blog support (English only for MVP)

## Package Usage Benefits

### Using Pre-built Packages Saves Time

**Note on R&D Time**: While these packages save significant development time, we've allocated 10 hours for developers to familiarize themselves with the packages, review documentation, and create integration prototypes. This upfront investment ensures smooth implementation.

## Technology Clarifications

### Why No API Development?
With Laravel 12's React starter kit and Inertia 2:
- All data flows through Inertia controllers
- No need for separate REST API endpoints
- TypeScript interfaces provide type safety
- Simpler architecture with less code

### Analytics in Filament
All analytics visualization happens within Filament admin:
- Custom widgets for real-time metrics
- Built-in chart components
- No third-party analytics tools needed
- Unified admin experience

### Blog System Architecture
Built directly in Laravel/Filament:
- Filament resource for blog management
- SEO-optimized frontend routes
- No external CMS needed
- Integrated with main site design

## Development Assumptions

- **Developer Level**: Senior developer with Laravel experience
- **Requirements**: Fully defined and stable
- **Environment**: Development environment ready
- **Testing**: Basic manual testing only (no automated test suite)

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Buffer Hours |
|------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Matching algorithm complexity | High | Extra time allocated, prototype early | 20 |
| Laravel 12 package compatibility | Medium | Use stable packages, have fallbacks | 10 |
| Performance optimization | Medium | Built-in caching, monitoring | 15 |
| SEO implementation | Medium | Follow proven patterns | 10 |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Security-first approach | 13 |
| **Total Risk Buffer** | | | **68** |

## Definition of Done

Each task is considered complete when:

- Code written and working
- Basic manual testing completed
- Documentation updated
- Security considerations addressed
