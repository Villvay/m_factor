## Critical Path Items

These items block other development and should be prioritized:

1. **Database Schema** - Blocks all other development
2. **Authentication System** - Required for all user features
3. **Matching Algorithm** - Core business logic
4. **Search Interface** - Primary user interaction
5. **Analytics Infrastructure** - Must be in place early to capture all touchpoints
