*Pending Laravel Cloud pricing verification

### MVP Infrastructure (Launch - 3 Months)
- **Laravel Cloud Starter**: $29/month* (best guess based on features)
- **Cloudflare Free**: $0
- **R2 Storage**: ~$5/month (minimal files)
- **Log Management**: $7/month (Papertrail 1GB plan)
- **Resend Email**: $0 (under 3K emails)
- **Total**: $41/month*

### Growth Infrastructure (3-6 Months)
- **Laravel Cloud Growth**: $59/month* (1GB RAM)
- **R2 Storage**: ~$10/month
- **Log Management**: $30/month (Papertrail 5GB)
- **Resend Email**: $20/month
- **Total**: $119/month*

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Laravel Cloud pricing shown above is estimated. Please verify actual pricing at https://cloud.laravel.com before budgeting. If pricing is significantly higher, consider Laravel Forge + DigitalOcean as an alternative.

### Log Management Strategy
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: Healthcare compliance requires 2-year audit log retention

**MVP Phase**: Papertrail 1GB ($7/mo) + PostgreSQL audit tables
**Growth Phase**: LogDNA/Papertrail 5GB ($30/mo) + R2 archive
**Scale Phase**: Papertrail 10GB ($65/mo) or self-hosted ELK + R2

**Log Types & Storage:**
- **Audit Logs**: PostgreSQL with partitioning (included in DB)
- **Application Logs**: Papertrail/LogDNA for real-time analysis
- **Security Logs**: Same service with alerts configured
- **Archive Storage**: Compress to R2 after 90 days (~$2/month for 2 years)

## Laravel Cloud Configuration

For the complete Laravel Cloud configuration file, see [Laravel Cloud Configuration](code-snippets.md#laravel-cloud-configuration) in the code snippets documentation.

## Hosting & Infrastructure Stack

- **[Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/)** - Managed Laravel hosting
- **[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/)** - Object storage (S3 compatible)
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** - Frontend hosting (if using Next.js)
- **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)** - CDN and security
- **[Resend](https://resend.com/)** - Email service (Laravel Cloud integrated)

## Service Decisions

### ‚úÖ Services You Need:
1. **Laravel Cloud** - Managed hosting with zero DevOps
2. **Cloudflare Free** - Adequate protection and CDN
3. **Cloudflare R2** - Cost-effective file storage
4. **Resend** - Reliable transactional email

### ‚ùå Services You DON'T Need:
1. **Cloudflare Pro** - Free tier is sufficient
2. **Separate Database Host** - Laravel Cloud includes it
3. **Meilisearch** - PostgreSQL search is fine for MVP
4. **External Redis** - Laravel Cloud includes it
5. **Grafana** - Laravel Pulse provides monitoring

### üîÑ Future Upgrades (When Needed):
1. **Cloudflare Pro** - Only if you need WAF rules
2. **Dedicated Database** - At 50K+ providers
3. **Elasticsearch** - At 100K+ searches/day
4. **CDN Storage** - If serving large media files

## Why These Services?

**Cloudflare Free is Sufficient Because:**
- ‚úÖ Unlimited bandwidth
- ‚úÖ Basic DDoS protection
- ‚úÖ SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ 3 page rules (enough for: force HTTPS, cache static assets, security headers)
- ‚úÖ Basic analytics

**You DON'T need Cloudflare Pro ($20/mo) unless you need:**
- ‚ùå WAF custom rules (Laravel has built-in security)
- ‚ùå Image optimization (R2 can handle this)
- ‚ùå Advanced bot protection (rate limiting handles most cases)
- ‚ùå 20+ page rules

**Laravel Cloud Advantages:**
- Zero DevOps required (saves 20+ hours)
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Built-in deployment from GitHub
- Managed PostgreSQL backups
- Redis included at all tiers
- One-click rollbacks
- No server management needed
- Automatic security updates

**Laravel Cloud Pricing Tiers:**
> **‚ö†Ô∏è WIP: Pricing needs verification**  
> If Laravel Cloud production starts at $20/hour (~$14,400/month), consider alternatives:
> - Laravel Forge + DigitalOcean ($12/mo + $6/mo)
> - Railway.app ($5-20/mo)
> - Render.com ($7-25/mo)

**Listed pricing (to be verified):**
- **Starter ($19/mo)**: 512MB RAM, perfect for MVP
- **Growth ($39/mo)**: 1GB RAM, handles 10K+ users
- **Scale ($99/mo)**: 4GB RAM, production ready
- **Custom**: Contact for enterprise needs

## Laravel Packages (Laravel 12 Compatible)

For the complete list of Laravel 12 compatible packages, see [Laravel Package Dependencies](code-snippets.md#laravel-package-dependencies) in the code snippets documentation.

### Key Time-Saving Packages
- **Lara Zeus Sky** - Complete blog system with SEO (saves ~24 hours)
- **Filament Laravel Auditing** - Audit trails with UI (saves ~12 hours)
- **Laravel Process Approval** - Approval workflows (saves ~18 hours)
- **Laravel 12 Starter Kit** - Authentication with social login (saves ~8 hours)
- **Filament Plugins** - Pre-built components and features

### Why Filament Plugins Over Standalone Packages

For Filament-based admin panels, always prefer Filament-specific plugins:

1. **Native Integration**: Built specifically for Filament's architecture
2. **Consistent UI**: Matches your admin panel design automatically
3. **Zero Custom Development**: No need to build Filament resources
4. **Better UX**: Enhanced features like timeline views, advanced filtering
5. **Maintained**: Active Filament community ensures compatibility

**Example**: Filament Laravel Auditing vs Laravel Auditing
- Standalone: Requires building custom Filament resource (4+ hours)
- Filament Plugin: Ready-to-use audit viewer (0 hours)

**Package Compatibility Note**: Since Laravel 12 was released in February 2025, some packages may still be updating for full compatibility. Most popular packages like Filament and Spatie packages typically update within days of a Laravel release. If you encounter compatibility issues:
1. Check the package's GitHub for Laravel 12 support issues
2. Use `composer require package/name:dev-main` for the latest development version
3. As a fallback, Laravel 11 remains supported until March 2026

## Key Decision Summary

1. **Use Cloudflare Free** - Pro features aren't needed for healthcare directory
2. **Start with Laravel Cloud $19** tier - Upgrade only when traffic demands
3. **PostgreSQL handles analytics** - No need for separate analytics DB initially
4. **R2 for documents only** - Provider certificates and profile photos
5. **Built-in monitoring** - Laravel Pulse instead of external tools

**Total MVP Cost: $31-40/month** (including proper logging for HIPAA compliance)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning**: 500MB log retention is completely inadequate for healthcare applications. HIPAA requires 2-year audit log retention. Budget includes proper log management service.
